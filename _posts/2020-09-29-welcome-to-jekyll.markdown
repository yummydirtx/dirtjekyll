The summer has come to an end. I've finished the C++ course, and am about to hop on the plane ride to Phoenix.
Lots was learned, but I think it's time to head back. Goodbye Massachusetts, see you soon.

The summer project is the worst. On the bright side, I've gotten really far in this C++ Tutorial [learncpp.com][learncpp]. It's pretty good, I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in learning C++. (But why listen to me, I'm no expert)

The 4th was pretty nice this year.
It started out pretty bad with us sitting in our grandparent's boat in the harbour, watching fireworks barely peek out over the trees in the distance. It kinda sucked until the people on the nearby beaches started shooting off fireworks as well.
Turns out people were bored and bought illegal fireworks because the entire horizon lit up in a fiery explosion of fireworks, *BANG* *BANG*
It was pretty great all things considered.

AHAHHAHAHA GOOGLE ANALYTICS ARE GONE!!!! HAIL ANARCHY!!!
Also I installed arch and it's not that great. Would not recommend.
Anyway check out my video, it kinda blew up.
Also I'm being hacked on my youtube. I think my phone has a virus.

I'm gonna try to learn how to type, but I don't know if I'll follow through the whole way because I can already type faster than I can think (about 60 wpm) so honestly this will probably turn into another failed idea.
I also was going to write letters to attempt to repeal the curfew in Phoenix but I can't find the name of the law/ordinance online so that's too bad.

I'm back.
I can finally hit shots with this new basketball, before it was super slippery. I can also dunk with it on 9ft rim. I would embed an image but I can't be bothered at he moment. I'm editing a website that expires in 9 months which is so expensive to renew that it will most certainly die. All that will be left after that is the archive of it which you are probably reading right now (I'm talking to you future me)
